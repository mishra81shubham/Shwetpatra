                                Amit Singhal has been working for BDO and at that time he was doing audits for Karcher India. I got to know him as a straightforward auditor who did an excellent job, fast and efficient. Also with the German HO his communication was clear and appreciated by our German colleagues.

                                Knowing and working with Amit has been extremely good. Worked on Wrigley assignments to begin, in his PWC stint and the kind of clarity he brought in as an SME has been phenomenal, along side suggesting appropriate tax positions. <br> Afterwards in another few assignments, he has been instrumental in bringing so much value addition to existing ways of working. His knack on Taxation, People connect and Clients centricity is by far the best I have
                                seen. Wish you well, Amit... Always

                                he took charge of the Direct taxes of the company and worked tirelessly with all hues of expert knowledge and fine interpersonal balance and PR skills. As expected he has since evolved as a very diligent and fine gentleman
                                professional and has taken strides in his career and I have no doubt he will he will achieve even greater heights. Best of luck !!

                            <blockquote>My interaction with Rakhee has been very recent. I was referred to Rakhee for leadership coaching. In each of the sessions she helped me reflect, introspect & look at things from a different perspective. Her coaching made me realize I can find answers within me for all the queries. Her compassionate & empathetic approach has been really encouraging for me to work on my shortcomings. </blockquote>
