                    <p>The primary role of a CFO in any organization is to oversee the financial planning, maintain and report on the financial activities, and manage financial risk of the business. Services offered by a virtual CFO often follow the financial pyramid of needs. In the basic level, a virtual CFO is expected to be the bookkeeper of the organisation receiving the vCFO services and has to take responsibility for the accuracy of the account books and interpret the financial information from the accounting data for the various stakeholders. vCFO takes the responsibility for executing or overseeing the reporting process. On the more strategic side, vCFO is the financial and strategic partner for the CEO. vCFO is also responsible for suggesting measures to control expenditure and acquire capital at low cost.</p>
